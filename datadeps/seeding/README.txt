This directory contains scripts that gather data for the utility matrix. They
can take a while to run but can be restarted at different checkpoints as
necessary.

Output files are CSV format with no header row.

This is separate from `../datadeps/` because scripts here contain many Reddit
API requests that can take a while.

For privacy reasons, do not commit any output data to git!
