# Reddrec Report
Evan Ram, Jessica Sanborn


### Project Topic
Reddrec is a web-app that recommends gaming subreddits to a user based on their reddit comment history. It takes in a username and uses the Reddit API to get your comment history then uses that data in a recommender system built from other reddit user's comment history. Our goal is to recommend new subreddits you have not previously explored as it can be difficult to find new communities.

### Data
Our data is made up of 100s of users past comments. We used comments as they are publicly avaliable and are assuming the more a user comments on something, the more they like it. We used the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) to get our data which made it very easy and fast to get vast amounts of data as opposed to scraping which we originally intended to do. Our final data consisted of 1072 reddit users and a count of how many times they commented on each of our 224 gaming subreddits.
